# bitshares_wallet
A bitshares-wallet for java
I get it from an Android application in [this page](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares_andriod_wallet).

And I mixed some question.

It can be used in Java Server such as Sping.

If you want to import this application.

```
git clone https://github.com/chouheiwa/bitshares_wallet.git

cd bitshares_wallet 

mvn assembly:single
```

Then a jar will be in Target

If you have any problem,please make an issue.
